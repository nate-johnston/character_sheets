<b>Healing Light</b>: At 1st level, you gain the ability to channel celestial energy to heal wounds. You have a pool of d6s that you spend to fuel this healing. The number of dice in the pool equals 1 + your warlock level. As a bonus action, you can heal one creature you can see within 60' of you, spending dice from the pool. The maximum number of dice you can spend at once equals your Charisma modifier (minimum 1). Roll the dice you spend, add them together, and restore a number of hit points equal to the total. Your pool regains all dice when you finish a long rest.<p>
<b>Amorphous Ooze</b>: You can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.  You can return to your natural ooze form as an action, or other gelatinous forms as well.<p>

</div>
<div id=quickcolumn>

<img src="https://natejohnston.info/kyoob/gelatinous_cube2.jpg" width=200 style="float: right; border: 1px;">

<b>Mimic</b>: As an action, you can transform your appearance. You decide what you look like, including your height, weight, facial features, the sound of your voice, coloration, hair length, sex, and any other distinguishing characteristics. You can make yourself appear as a member of another race, although none of your game statistics change. You also can't appear as a creature a different size than you, and your basic shape stays the same: if you're bipedal, you can't use this trait to become quadrupedal, for instance. Your clothing and other equipment don't change in appearance, size, or shape to match your new form, requiring you to keep a few extra outfits on hand to make the most compelling disguise possible.  Even to most observers, the ruse is usually indiscernable. If you arouse suspicion, or if a wary creature suspects something is amiss, you have advantage on any Charisma (Deception) check you make to avoid detection.  You can also assume the appearance of any creature you have consumed through your Mnemonic Echoes feature. You can remember a number of appearances equal to your Intelligence modifier (<%= $bonus_array[$int] %>).<p>
<b>Mnemonic Echoes</b>: The myriad of dissonant voices echoes within your being, granting you knowledge not your own. You gain skill proficiecy of your choice, one tool proficiency of your choice, and fluency in one language of your choice. Whenever a humanoid creature dies within 5 feet of you, you can spend your reaction to consume the target. Once consumed, after your next long rest, you may change either your skill proficiency, tool proficiency, or language fluency to one of the proficiencies or languages of the creature.<p>
<b>Warlock</b>: You are a Warlock, with a sacred pact with the angel Raziel.  You are his agent in the world, fighting darkness and evil.<p>
<% if $level >= 4 %>
<u>Haunting Mimicry</u>: When you assume a form of a consumed humanoid, you also devour their thoughts and memories. You gain the following benefits: <ul><li>Increase your Intelligence or Charisma score by 1, to a maximum 20. <li>Whenever you assume an appearance of a creature consumed by your Mnemonic Echoes feature, you gain access to all information that the humanoid would freely share with a casual acquaintance. Such information includes general details on its background and personal life but doesn't include secrets. The information is enough that you can pass yourself off as the person by drawing on its memories. <li>Your uncanny portrayal of the Mnemonic Echoes strikes fear to even those who knew them in life. If you speak to a humanoid for at least 1 minute, you can attempt to spark paranoia in their mind. At the end of the conversation, you make a Charisma (Deception) check contested against the target's Wisdom (Insight) check. On a success, the target is frightened of you for 1 hour, unless it is attacked or damaged, or until it witnesses its allies being attacked or damaged. If the target succeeds on its saving throw, the target has no hint that you tried to frighten it. Once you use this ability, you can't do so again until after you finish a short or long rest.</ul><p>
<% end %>
<% if $level >= 8 %>
<u>Morphic Body</u>: You do not possess the normal anatomy of a solid being, allowing you to shift or move vital organs out of harm's way. You gain the following benefits: Increase your Constitution score by 1, to a maximum of 20. Whenever you are hit by an attack that is a critical hit, you can use your reaction to turn the triggering attack to a normal hit.

How long did I exist before?  I do not know; I cared little for the passage of
time.  But the moment that I touched that book, is the moment that I count my
time from.  I was what you call a "gelatinous cube".  It is a terribly incorrect
term, but do not worry that you have offended me; my people care nothing for
names.
  <p>

I was as I had always been, sliding along the corridors of the dungeon where I
made my abode, when I touched it.  It.  The book.  I felt it's leathery cover
and paper pages caress my edge, and suddenly I felt a new awareness, as though
something new had entered the room coming through a door inside my being.  A
door that I did not even knew existed had suddenly become a portal, and that
which came through addressed me.  It seemed humanoid, yet wreathed in a fire
that did not burn or heat the stone.
  <p>

"Oh dear, it looks like Sir Valeric won't be able to help me any more" it said.
  <p>

I felt the thoughts of the creature, and knew it's name was Raziel, that it is
a great Angel of Good, a Solar.  It seemed to be indicating the bones dissolving
inside me, belonging to the carcass of some unfortunate meat stick that had met
it's demise.  Raziel seemed ready to disappear, and suddenly I felt a strong
desire for it to stay, stronger even than the Hunger.  I made my surface vibrate
to imitate the sound Raziel had made, and said, "Wait, stay.  I help."
  <p>

I do not know what transpired at that point, only that Raziel stopped all
motion - even breathing - for a full 98 seconds (we can attend to the passage of
time if we wish).  Perhaps it was surprised, or perhaps it was communicating
with some other associate in a way I could not percieve.  After the long pause,
Raziel said, "Never have I had an offer from one such as you.  Why would you
want to help?"
  <p>

"You... show... new... way... different... never... seen... before..."
  <p>

Again, silence.  And then a sudden, resolute action. "Very well," said Raziel,
"It is a deal.  You are mine, and you will work toward the good of all
thinking creatures.  I share my power with you, that you may be my agent, and I
your patron.  This pact is a sacred bond that links us now."
  <p>

That is how I came to leave the dungeon, and learn to take the irregular, lumpy
forms of the solids.  I walk among them, seeking those that would kill or use
dark powers of undeath.  They are Raziel's enemies, and so they are mine.  I
seek to infiltrate their ranks, discover their power, and through sudden swift
action be the instrument of my lord's just retribution.  
  <p>

Raziel showed me the world, a world beyond just the darkness and the Hunger, a
world that still seems fresh and new to me.  For that alone I would always be
devouted.

            </ul>
            Description: You create a ghostly, skeletal hand in the space of a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the creature to assail it with the chill of the grave. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 necrotic damage, and it can't regain hit points until the start of your next turn. Until then, the hand clings to the target. If you hit an undead target, it also has disadvantage on attack rolls against you until the end of your next turn. This spell's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

            Description: A beam of crackling energy streaks towards a creature within range.  On a hit, the target takes 1d10 force damage. The spell creates more than one beam when you reach higher levels: two beams at 5th level, three beams at 11th level, and four beams at 17th level. You can direct the beams at the same target or at different ones. Make a separate attack roll for each beam.

            Description: You touch one object that is no larger than 10 feet in any dimension. Until the spell ends, the object sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. The light can be colored as you like. Completely covering the object with something opaque blocks the light. The spell ends if you cast it again or dismiss it as an action. If you target an object held or worn by a hostile creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw to avoid the spell.

            Description: You point your finger toward a creature within range and whisper a message. The target (and only the target) hears the message and can reply in a whisper that only you can hear.
You can cast this spell through solid objects if you are familiar with the target and know it is beyond the barrier. Magical silence. 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood blocks the spell. The spell doesn't have to follow a straight line and can travel freely around corners or through openings.

<div class="hp" width=100%>FAMILIAR RULES</div>

You gain the service of a familiar, a spirit that takes an animal form you choose: bat, cat, crab, frog (toad), hawk, lizard, octopus, owl, poisonous snake, fish (quipper), rat, raven, sea horse, spider, or weasel. Appearing in
an unoccupied space within range, the familiar has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice) instead of a beast. <p>
Your familiar acts independently of you, but it always obeys your commands. In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn. A familiar can't attack, but it can take other actions as normal. <p>
When the familiar drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. It reappears after you cast this spell again <p>
While your familiar is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. Additionally, as an action, you can see through your familiar's eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn. gaining the benefits of any special senses that the familiar has. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses. <p>
As an action, you can temporarily dismiss your familiar. It disappears into a pocket dimension where it awaits your summons. Alternatively, you can dismiss it forever. As an action while it is temporarily dismissed,
you can cause it to reappear in any unoccupied space within 30 feet of you. <p>
You can't have more than one familiar at a time. If you cast this spell while you already have a familiar, you instead cause it to adopt a new form. Choose one of the forms from the above list. Your familiar transforms into the chosen creature. <p>
Finally, when you cast a spell with a range of touch, your familiar can deliver the spell as if it had cast the spell. Your familiar must be within 100 feet of you, and it must use its reaction to deliver the spell when you cast it. If the spell requires an attack roll, you use your attack modifier for the roll. <p>
